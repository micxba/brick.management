75314 The Bad Batch Attack Shuttle

Fun build and horrible to display. It takes up a ton of room off of want to display it wings down.
I think Lego did a fantastic job with the Minifigs. The shuttle itself is a tad disappointing. Wish they would have skipped the speeders and added detail to the shuttle. Also wish that Omega would have been in there.
