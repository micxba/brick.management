75312 Boba Fett’s Starship

I know there was some controversy or disagreement from Disney’s decision to rename this iconic ship but I believe they made the right decision.

I think the build is absolutely fantastic. Maybe not as detailed as the previous 20th anniversary edition but super solid.
Having a prop stand that comes with out is a great bonus. 10/10
