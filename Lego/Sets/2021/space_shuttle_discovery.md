title: space shuttle discovery (10283)

The NASA Space Shuttle Discovery set is a nice build and display model. Love the choice of three display modes with Hubble next to it, inside the bay or on stand inside the bay.

Part of the NASA Discovery set, I think this part deserves more mention. Itâ€™s very well executed and displays nicely on its own.
