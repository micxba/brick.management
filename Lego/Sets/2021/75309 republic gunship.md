# 75309 Republic Gunship

Several posts already about this build and while I have finished it sind time ago I just now get around to posting it. It’s a great build. Well designed sorry of the nubbin inside that keeps coming off. My only complaint is that it does not display well. The wings are wide ie the ship is huge. Tried taking off one wing to better display on a 16” shelf but it falls over. So great build but need to figure out how to really display it. Ideas?
