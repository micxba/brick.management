Quite a nice set. Fortunate that my local Costco had it a couple weeks earlier than the official Lego release. Set is a little bit smaller than I would’ve anticipated. But I guess it is the right size for the price. Some very nice mini fix however I would’ve loved a second Gomorran guard in lieu of the dancer Minifig.
