## Imperial Star Destroyer

### Devestator

Started to build on this amazing set. Definitely see a lot of gray after a while LOL.
This set is a little more challenging than I thought at first. Because of the same color almost everywhere, if a piece falls - good luck finding where it came from.  
Besides that though - it is an amazin set. It is quite massive and allows for a beautiful display piece. 
Ideally don't move it around much as transporting it can produce carnage.
