75306 Imperial Probe Droid

New set released of the infamous Probe Droid from ‘The Empire Strikes Back’.
The build itself is OK, it has a few parts that would come off easily if you handle it. As a display set however, as it is intended it’s an interesting part of the collection. It only took a relatively short time to build. It has a lot of extra parts from dark grey tool bags (unnumbered bags)
