# 75192 Millennium Falcon UCS

A little late to the party but I finally finished building this set of sets. I have no idea where I’ll put it, so I think it’ll have a permanent residency on our dining room table. 
As for the set itself, I love the build. While there are obviously many small parts it’s fun throughout. I wish they would have interlocked the top panels a bit better instead of just setting them on there but no biggie.
