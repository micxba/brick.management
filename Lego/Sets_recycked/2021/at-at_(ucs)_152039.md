# 75313 AT-AT (UCS)

Fantastic build of an all-time classic. Most of the mechanics were done very well. I am not a huge fan of single-peg parts that fall off every time you touch it but once displayed it is no longer an issue.
The build itself was great. They made use of several building techniques I have not see before.
For the first time in my Lego building history, Lego Group actually missed two bricks. I never had missing parts before. Since it was just for the “wrench”, not a huge deal and I am getting replacements very soon.
